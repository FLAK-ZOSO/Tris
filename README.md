# Future changes
- [ ] Make the instance function [`Box.check()`](https://github.com/FLAK-ZOSO/Tris/blob/65c6a01ded97d987f7aabe1f3f5d8644ae963860/Tris.py#L14) more efficient.
- [ ] Add a control to the function `game()` to delete from [`Matches.json`](https://github.com/FLAK-ZOSO/Tris/blob/2e68d1dab5c43d7d24307f4817746f9313fb8f29/Matches.json) all those matches which are duplicates.
- [ ] Add a control to the function `game()` to delete from [`Matches.json`](https://github.com/FLAK-ZOSO/Tris/blob/2e68d1dab5c43d7d24307f4817746f9313fb8f29/Matches.json) all [those matches which are read more than X times](https://github.com/FLAK-ZOSO/Tris/wiki/Wrong-games).
- [ ] Make the lines of the table to be aligned even if the value of the first case isn't `1` (the `chr('1')` is less wide than `'X'` or `'O'`)
